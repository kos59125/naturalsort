Description:
    The package provides functions related to human natural ordering.
    It handles adjacent digits in a character sequence as a number
    so that natural sort function arranges a character vector by their numbers, not digit characters.
    It is typically seen when operating systems lists file names.
    For example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png looks naturally ordered
    because 1 < 2 < 10 and natural sort algorithm arranges so whereas general sort algorithms arrange
    it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their third characters.
