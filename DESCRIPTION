Description: Provides functions related to human natural ordering.
    It handles adjacent digits in a character sequence as a number so that
    natural sort function arranges a character vector by their numbers, not digit
    characters. It is typically seen when operating systems lists file names. For
    example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png looks naturally ordered because 1
    < 2 < 10 and natural sort algorithm arranges so whereas general sort algorithms
    arrange it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their third and fourth
    characters.
